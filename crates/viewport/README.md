# viewport
`viewport` is a user-facing terminal manipulation library. It is designed to 
provide unintrusive and transparent abstractions over the cross-platform 
terminal library, [`crossterm`](https://github.com/crossterm-rs/crossterm), to 
build responsive and rich terminal user interfaces (TUIs).

`viewport` is currently a WIP. It was started as part of the 
[`opal`](https://github.com/marc1/opal) terminal file manager project.
